# Rooster Grin Front End Dev Test

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS Grid
- JS

## "What we think, we become" - Buddha

I utilized HTML, CSS, and JS on this project to focus on improving my skills in
these technologies. Specifically, I wanted to get a better understading of how
CSS Grid works - to get an idea of how it functions as a stand alone techology
in styling.

### Blockers

Like most projects, I did face some blockers on this project. These include:

- Getting a basic understanding for how CSS Grid functions. I spent the first 3
  days working to figure out and plan the best way to outline the project. This
  was not an efficient use of time. As a result, I wasn't able to spend more
  time on other aspects of the project such more functionality and personality
  that I like to put into my projects as finishing touches.
- I had difficulty cloning/forking the repo and received errors working with the
  forked repo. I am still not sure what I was doing wrong.

## Fun

- I loved working on the project as it created an opportunity for me to
  challenge myself in ways that I have not before. Previously, I did not have
  much understanding of CSS Grid. Although, I am not an expert by any means, and
  there were times I was very frustrated with that little girl on banner-2.jpg
  with her laughing at me (while I struggled and ultimately could not figure the
  thing out for the life of me), I have a much better understanding of CSS grid.
- I loved structuring my plan of attack each day. Once I got into my work flow,
  I would make a plan and check things off the list. My most productive days
  were the most challenging and rewarding too.
- One of the best things I can take away from this project is I had an
  opportunity to truly challenge my abilities as a front-end web developer and I
  have identified areas I need to improve.Thank you!
